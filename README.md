# Implemetation of Otsu's Thresholding Algorithm

This project implements Otsu's Thresholding algorithm from scratch using NumPy and OpenCV, and analyzes its performance under varying levels of Gaussian noise. The algorithm automatically selects an optimal threshold for binarizing grayscale images by maximizing inter-class variance.

## Features
Manual implementation of Otsu's method (no use of cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

Histogram plotting to visualize pixel intensity distributions

Simulation of real-world conditions by adding Gaussian noise

## Language

python

# Libraries Used

openCV,numpy,matplotlib
